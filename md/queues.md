# Queues

A queue is characterized by its **First In, First Out (FIFO) behavior**. This means that data
is always added to the back of a queue, and it can only be removed once it has finally 
advanced to the very front of the queue. 

**Thus, the order that data leaves a queue will be the same order in which it entered the queue.**

Compared to other data structures, a queue's behavior is relatively simple and easy to
understand from a real-world perspective. When data enters a queue, it is just taking its
place to wait at the back of a line like its human counterparts do all the time. The most
obvious difference is that data is perfectly patient when waiting its turn (which is a far cry 
from what transpires at the DMV), so data never tries to "cut" when waiting its turn to exit
the queue, nor does it try to leave the queue early.

&nbsp;
## Queue Usage in Technology
Technology utilizes queues extensively. Queues provide structure and order when automated tasks 
must be carried out, and they provide a way for resources to be shared without overwhelming 
and crashing a system. 

### Printer Queues
Way back when printers were prohibitively expensive, it was common practice for many users
to all share the same printer. The printer would end up receiving tons of print job requests,
so it would organize these requests into a queue to methodically print every request.

![Illustration depicting how a printer queue works](../images/printer_queue.png)
Personal printers may be much easier to purchase nowadays, but it still accomplishes all its
printing tasks by starting with the request that was received first, then the second request,
followed by the third request, and so on.

**Additional Examples of Queues Include:**
* **CPU scheduling**, in which the operating system determines which process will be 
run by the CPU based on its place in a queue. Some higher priority processes do get to
skip over others, but "first come, first served" queues are typically used during times 
when mostly routine maintenance processes are in the queue.
* **Company call centers**, which determine which customer gets to speak to a representative
next based on how long they've been in the waiting queue.
* **Websites**, which can't handle all HTTP requests at once. It serves each request using 
queues, which helps ensure that website response times aren't sluggish.

&nbsp;
## Queue Implementation
Queues can be implemented in many different coding languages in addition to Python, including 
C, C++, and Java. Even though the actual implementation details vary based on which coding language is being used, the set of operations associated with queues will remain the same.

In Python, queues are **implemented using lists**:

![example of a queue object in Python being instantiated using a list](../images/queue_instantiate.png)

Lists in Python are **dynamic arrays**.

This means a queue's data will be stored in memory addresses that are contiguous to each other. This will play a large role in determining the
performance level of each operation.

## Queue Operations 
&nbsp;
  Operation    |     Description     |     Example<br>*(in Python)*     |  Performance
-------------- | ------------------- | --------------- | --------------
enqueue(value) | "value" is added to the back of the queue. | a_queue.append(value) | O(1) - Appending to the back of the queue always occurs in constant time.
dequeue()      | Removes and returns the value at the front of the queue. | value = a_queue[0]<br>del a_queue[0]<br>*or*<br>value = a_queue.pop(0) | O(n) - Removing the value at index 0 results in a shift in which all elements move up the queue by one index value. Every element must be iterated through to perform this shift.
size()         | Returns the number of elements in the queue. | length = len(a_queue) | O(1) - Queues keep track of its<br>size internally. No iterations are necessary when len() is called.
is_empty()     | Checks if the queue is empty. | if len(a_queue) == 0: | O(1) - Queues keep track of its<br>size internally, so no loops are necessary.

```

Note that **deque** (pronounced as *"deck"*) provides a **more efficient implementation of the dequeue operation.** It is a more versatile object from Python's collections module that can add and remove elements from the back *and* the front using linked lists as its basis instead of dynamic arrays.

Deque stands for "double-ended queue" because it adds and removes elements from both ends in constant O(1) time. By using linked lists, operations like dequeue become more efficient because there is no shifting of elements located in contiguous memory addresses.

## Example: Movie Ticket Queue
Imagine a bustling movie theater with a long line of excited moviegoers eagerly waiting to purchase their tickets. This scenario perfectly embodies the "First In, First Out" principle that defines queues.

Although, the ticket-purchasing dynamics aren't always as straightforward as one might assume. Oftentimes people attending the movies as a group will stand in line together, then a single member of the group purchases tickets on behalf of everyone. 

This example demonstrates how queues, despite their straightforward nature, are still able to adapt to this slight twist when determining whose up next to buy tickets without any additional effort.

## Digging Deeper: Queues vs. Stacks 
One of the interesting things about queues is that it has a sibling data structure, so to
speak, called stacks. Stacks, like queues, are implemented in Python using lists.

While queues are the main focus of this lesson, it is worth bringing up stacks because 
understanding their similarities and differences comes in handy when trying to decide
between using a queue or a stack in a program. 

### Similarities
* As dynamic arrays, queues and stacks are both stored in contiguous memory addresses.
* Their elements can be accessed easily.
* Queues and stacks have no fixed sizes. They can grow in size as more elements are added.
* A user may have to create a larger queue or stack if they run out of memory, 
but this does not occur frequently.
* Neither one inserts or removes data from somewhere in between the first and last indices.

### Differences
* Queues use First In, First Out (FIFO) behavior, whereas stacks use Last In, First Out (LIFO) behavior.
* With LIFO, data gets added *and* removed from the end of the list. The data element that was most recently 
added to a stack will be the first to leave it. 
* Think of stacks like adding and removing ceramic plates from a whole stack of breakable plates. In order 
to avoid a very shattering case of plate extinction, plates are stored by stacking each new plate top of 
each other, and they are retrieved by selecting whichever plate is currently on the very top of the stack.

### Can data be added or removed from somewhere in the middle of Queues and/or Stacks?
Technically speaking, additional code can be written to make these things possible. However,  
only being able to add data in the back and remove data from the front are characteristics that
define a queue. Likewise, only being able to add and remove data from the back is what defines
a stack. So, once a queue or a stack class breaks out of their defined behaviors, then they aren't
necessarily considered queues or stacks any more.

&nbsp;
## Final Problem to Solve: Library Book Waitlist Queue
To practice using a queue in a program, try designing a waitlist queue for a library
system. This program is just a simplified version, so it doesn't need to take all 
aspects of an actual library waitlist into consideration.

### Specifications

**Design a class called Waitlist_Queue:**
* The only attribute that a Waitlist_Queue object requires is a list called "queue".
* The queue attribute will store library card barcodes. 
    * Library systems don't place people on waitlists using their names. They need a more unique 
    identifier, which is why the barcode from a person's library card is used instead.  
* Only implement the operations of a queue as methods for this class. No "bonus" print method is necessary
(that will be included in the Book class).

**Design another class called Book:**
* A Book object will have a title, an inventory number, and a Waitlist_Queue object called "waitlist"
as its attributes.
* Implement the is_available() method to check if a book is currently available to check out.
* Implement the add_waitlist() method to add the barcode of a person's library card to a book's waitlist 
if it is unavailable.
* Implement the check_out() method, which either "checks out" a book by adjusting its inventory size,
or it places someone (using their library card barcode) onto the book's waiting list when they attempt
to check out a currently unavailable book.
* Implement the return_book() method so a book gets added back into the inventory if its waitlist is
empty, or it "gives" the book to the next person on the waitlist.
* Implement the print_waitlist() method to show all the card barcodes that are stored in a book's waitlist.
Rank each barcode according to its position in the waitlist (1 would be at the front).
* Implement the display_status() method to provide updates on a book's status.
    * Is the book available to be checked out?
    * If it isn't available, then is there currently a waitlist?
    * If there is a waitlist, then what is its size? How is the waitlist currently ranked?


Trying to solve this problem from scratch is encouraged. However, if additional
guidance if needed, try solving [this version of the problem instead.](python/queue-solution.py)
